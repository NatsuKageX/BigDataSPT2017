    <strong>Title</strong>:  Quantum-Search Algorithms, Quantum Codes and All That...<u> </u>
  </p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Since Marconi demonstrated the feasibility of radio transmissions, researchers have endeavored to realize the dream of flawless wireless multimedia telecommunications, creating the impression of tele-presence - at the touch of a dialling key... </p><p>However, making this dream a reality required 'quantum' leaps both in digital signal processing and in its nano-electronics based implementation, facilitated by advances in science both in Edinburgh and farther afield. This process has been fueled by a huge consumer market. Moore's laws has indeed prevailed since he outlined his empirical rule-of-thumb in 1965, but based on this the scale of integration is set to depart from classical physics obeying the well-understood rules revealed by science and enter into a new world, where the traveler has to obey the sometimes strange new rules of the quantum-world. The quest for quantum-domain communication solutions was inspired by Feynman's revolutionary idea in 1985: particles such as photons or electrons might be relied upon for encoding, processing and delivering information. During the last three decades researchers and engineers often considered a pair of open problems. Firstly, classic systems relying on the efficient processing capability of quantum-search algorithms were considered in the area of quantum-assisted communications, while the branch of quantum-domain communications relies on quantum channels. The latter may simply be constituted by the deleterious effects of the environment perturbing the quantum-state particles.In wireless communications we often encounter large-scale search problems, some of which may be efficiently solved with the aid of bio-inspired random guided algorithms or quantum-search techniques. For example, Grover's algorithm is capable of searching through an N-element data-base with the aid of √N cost-function evaluations. Commencing with a brief historical perspective, a variety of efficient quantum-assisted solutions will be exemplified.</p>

    <strong>Title</strong>:  Dual-Centric Data Center Network Architectures<u> </u>
  </p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Existing Data Center Network (DCN) architectures are classified into two categories: switch-centric and server-centric architectures. In switch-centric DCNs, routing intelligence is placed on switches; each server usually uses only one port?often Network Interface Card (NIC) to connect to the switches. In server-centric DCNs, switches are only used as cross-bars, and routing intelligence is placed on servers, where multiple NIC ports may be used. However, discussions on and comparisons between switch-centric and server-centric architectures are not done in consistent and standard metrics. We propose unified performance models for both switch-centric and server-centric DCN architectures, and can be applied to general DCN architectures. We also formally introduce a new category of DCN architectures: the dual-centric DCN architectures, where routing intelligence can be placed on both switches and servers. We propose three typical dual-centric DCN architectures: FCell, FRectangle, and FSquare. All of them are based on the folded Clos topology. FSquare is a high performance DCN architecture, in which the diameter is small and the bisection bandwidth is large; however, the DCN power consumption per server in FSquare is high. FCell significantly reduces the DCN power consumption per server, compared to FSquare, at the sacrifice of some performances; thus, FCell has a larger diameter and a smaller bisection bandwidth. FRectangle exists as a tradeoff between FSquare and FCell; it has a lower diameter than FCell, and the DCN power consumption per server is lower than FSquare. By investigating the three proposed architectures themselves, and by comparing them with existing architectures, we demonstrate that, these novel dual-centric architectures enjoy the advantages of both switch-centric designs and server-centric designs, have various nice properties for practical data centers, and provide flexible tradeoff choices in designing DCN architectures.</p>

    <strong>Title</strong>:  Autonomous and Connected Vehicles: A New Challenge for Smart Cities<u> </u>
  </p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this presentation, we share results from several major research projects related to the design of "cognitive" cars and smart roads applications through the DIVA Strategic Research Network, the TRANSIT Network and the PARADISE Research Laboratory at the University of Ottawa. First, we will review the main challenges of this work include modeling, simulation and design issues and discuss some results obtained recently. Next, we will talk about LIVE testbed, a convergence of distributed simulation, wireless multimedia and vehicular sensor technologies we are developing at DIVA and PARADISE Research Laboratory for an urban vehicular grid.

    <strong>Title</strong>:  Big Data - Big Application<u> </u>
  </p><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Right now, Big Data, Data Science or Data Analytics are being on wide interest in industry and academia. During this talk, we will discuss two questions based on my research industry engagement practice. </p>
  <p>The first one is business gain from such buzz words. This is a practical question from business. Based on my research, big data can help business to identify big niche market opportunity which can grow up to become major markets. For example, by analysing and generalising potential weak connection between previously sparse data sources such as flight booking data and supermarket user data, we can better expand or enhance the market for personal recommendation on flight booking.</p>
  <p>The second one is about how researchers can make a full potential to business. A say is "It's not who has the best algorithm that wins. It's who has the most data" by Andrew Ng (Coursea founder). Data is becoming an important resource equally important to oil. While various public datasets are available to academics or researchers for research evaluation, those datasets may not be suitable or useful and timely for researchers. One way to make full potential of big data is to intensively work with industry because they have timely data. More or less, every industry is doing data analysis yet just on their specific purposes. We will brief our research and collaboration with specific industries.</p>
